"""Thin wrapper around the `keyring` library for OS-managed secret storage.

Used only when `securityMode == "os_keyring"`. The watchdog stores the
derived master key under (`service`, `username`) so a power outage or
service restart auto-recovers without the operator re-typing the
passphrase. The OS-level boundary on that store is whatever the
underlying backend provides:

  * Windows: WinVault / Credential Manager — per-Windows-user
  * macOS: Keychain — per-macOS-user, may prompt on first access
  * Linux: Secret Service (gnome-keyring / KWallet) — per-session,
    requires a running daemon

The library auto-selects the highest-priority available backend; on
headless Linux without an unlocked secret service the active backend
becomes a `fail` one. Every call here is wrapped in a broad except
so a missing/locked backend never crashes the watchdog — the
operator just falls through to the passphrase-prompt path.

Storage shape: master key is 32 random bytes (derived via Argon2id);
keyring backends take strings, so we base64-encode at store time
and decode at load time.
