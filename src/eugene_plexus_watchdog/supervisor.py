"""Subprocess supervisor for Eugene Plexus body components.

Spawns child processes per the topology in `watchdog.yaml`, threads the
right env vars through (config-file path, bind port parsed from the
component's URL, safe-mode flag), and respawns any child that exits.
The "I'll restart Eugene's heart for you" piece — the watchdog's whole
reason to exist in v0.1.

Long-term (v0.2+) the orchestrator absorbs this responsibility because
process supervision IS interoception in the brain analogy. See
`project_supervisor_as_interoception` in the project memory directory.
For now, the watchdog is the medulla — autonomic reflex layer that
keeps things running without thinking.

## Cross-platform notes

`asyncio.subprocess.Process.terminate()` is the graceful-shutdown signal
we use on every supervised exit. On POSIX that maps to SIGTERM (children
get a chance to flush logs and answer their last in-flight request). On
Windows it's `TerminateProcess`, which is a hard kill — no graceful
window. Living with that for v0.1 personal-use; Windows is primarily a
dev surface, real installs are Linux/Mac/Docker.
