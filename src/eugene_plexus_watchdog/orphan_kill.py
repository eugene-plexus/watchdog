"""Cross-platform orphan-prevention for supervised children.

Without this, hard-killing the watchdog (SIGKILL on POSIX,
TerminateProcess on Windows, OS crash, power loss) leaves spawned
children orphaned. They keep running until manually terminated, which
on a personal-use install is at best annoying (port still bound) and
at worst confusing ("I killed Eugene but he's still answering").

Two approaches, picked per-platform:

- **Linux**: each spawned child registers `prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG,
  SIGTERM)` in its `preexec_fn` so the kernel sends SIGTERM to the
  child whenever its parent dies, regardless of how. Implemented via
  `ctypes` to avoid pulling in a third-party prctl wrapper.

- **Windows**: the watchdog creates a Job Object with the
  `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` flag and assigns each spawned
  child to it. When the watchdog process exits (any way), the kernel
  closes the job handle, which kills every assigned child. This
  generalizes cleanly to "the watchdog is the root of a process tree
  the OS will tear down for us."

- **macOS**: macOS has no direct equivalent of pdeathsig. We could use
  kqueue's NOTE_EXIT but that requires polling; for v0.1 we accept the
  same orphan-on-hard-kill risk POSIX-without-prctl always had. Add
  better handling here when v0.2 hardens supervision.

Tests for the platform-specific paths are deliberately light — actually
exercising prctl or Job Objects requires forking real processes. The
core test asserts the right cross-platform `setup_for_kind()` was
selected based on `sys.platform`.
