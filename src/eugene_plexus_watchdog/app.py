"""FastAPI app factory.

The supervisor is wired into the lifespan: at startup the watchdog reads
its topology config and asks the supervisor to spawn every spawned-mode
child; on shutdown it stops them in turn (SIGTERM with timeout, then
SIGKILL). The /v1/components routes layer delegates real-time status
queries to the supervisor so `Component.status` reflects live process
state instead of the skeleton's hard-coded `unreachable`.

v0.2 also seeds `app.state.auth_state` with a fresh JWT signing key on
every startup. The master encryption key starts None and gets populated
either by (a) the OS keyring auto-unlock at lifespan startup when
`securityMode == "os_keyring"`, or (b) on a successful POST
/v1/auth/initialize or /v1/auth/login. When (a) succeeds, children
spawned in this same lifespan get MASTER_KEY in their env immediately
— no Phase-7 restart-on-login churn needed.
