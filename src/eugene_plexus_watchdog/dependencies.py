"""FastAPI dependencies for v0.2 auth.

Two main dependencies:

  * `require_initialized` — short-circuits with 503 when the operator
    hasn't yet set a passphrase. Endpoints that are only meaningful
    on a configured install (everything except /healthz and
    /v1/auth/initialize) declare this.

  * `require_operator_session` — validates a `Authorization: Bearer ...`
    token. Raises 401 on missing / malformed / expired / revoked.
    Returns the decoded `TokenPayload` for downstream use.

Service-token verification is a separate dependency
(`require_service_token`) so endpoints can scope themselves correctly
(e.g. POST /v1/identity/links/pending is service-only; PATCH
/v1/identity/constitution is operator-only).

  * `require_operator_or_service` — accepts an operator session token
    OR *any* `service:*`-audience token. Used by the read-only topology
    endpoints (`GET /v1/components`, `GET /v1/components/{name}`) so peer
    components can auto-resolve each other's URLs with their service
    token. Mutating topology routes stay operator-only. (v0.2.1: before
    this, the whole `/v1/components` router was operator-only, so every
    peer auto-resolve silently fell back to localhost defaults —
    project_watchdog_components_auth_mismatch.)
