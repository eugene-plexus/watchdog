"""Console capture: mirror watchdog stdout/stderr to a rotating log file.

The watchdog process is the single point where every supervised body
component's output flows through (via `supervisor.SupervisedProcess.
_pipe_child_output`), alongside the watchdog's own uvicorn logs. That
combined stream is by far the most useful diagnostic surface — but
in an interactive terminal it scrolls off, and operators can't share
it with bug reports unless they remembered to redirect output at
task-launch time. Asking operators to edit task commands or set env
vars violates the project's GUI-equality principle: anything an
operator might need belongs in the UI or it happens automatically.

This module installs a same-process tee: every write to stdout/stderr
forwards to the original stream (so the live terminal is unchanged)
AND to a rotating log file. The file copy has ANSI SGR escapes
stripped so it renders cleanly in any text editor or Slack paste.

Defaults are hardcoded and require no operator action:

  - Path: `<config_file dir>/logs/watchdog.log`
    (i.e. next to `watchdog.yaml`, wherever the operator chose to put it)
  - 10 MB per file, 5 backups (50 MB max disk per stream)

Tuning these would mean adding fields to the config_store + UI controls
— deferred to v0.3 along with the rest of the logging-config UX.
