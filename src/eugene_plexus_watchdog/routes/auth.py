"""Auth endpoints: passphrase initialize, login, logout.

Two-state lifecycle:

  * **Uninitialized** — first run, no passphrase set. Only
    `POST /v1/auth/initialize` and `GET /healthz` work; every other
    endpoint returns 503 "Setup required" until initialize succeeds.

  * **Initialized** — passphrase set. Login is open; everything else
    requires a bearer token.

Login uses Argon2id-PHC verification (constant-time). Successful
login derives the master key from the passphrase + stored salt and
caches it in `AuthState.master_key` so the supervisor can thread it
to spawned children that need to decrypt at-rest secrets.

Rate-limiting: bucket per source IP, 5 failures within 60 seconds
locks the source out for 60 seconds. Cleared on success.
