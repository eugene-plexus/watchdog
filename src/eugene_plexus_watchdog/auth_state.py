"""In-memory auth state for the watchdog process.

Holds runtime secrets the watchdog should never persist:

  * `signing_key` — 32 random bytes generated at every startup. HMAC
    signs all JWTs (session + service tokens). Rotating at every
    restart effectively revokes all outstanding tokens (good-enough
    v0.2 revocation).
  * `master_key` — 32 bytes derived from the operator's passphrase
    via Argon2id. Encrypts apiKey-style fields on each child's disk.
    Threaded to spawned children via env var at startup.
  * `revoked_tokens` — set of JWT IDs (or full token strings) the
    operator has logged out. Cleared at restart along with the
    signing key.

This state lives in `app.state.auth_state` after the lifespan
initializes it. The supervisor reaches into it to read the master
key + service tokens at spawn time. The routes layer reads it to
validate session tokens. Nothing else touches it.
